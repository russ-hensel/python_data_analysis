   5 the most often used phrase in the lamestream media by far is \xe2\x80\x9csources say\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cofficials who spoke on the condition of anonymity\xe2\x80\x9d or anything similar which allows fake news to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist. the american people should demand names!
